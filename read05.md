# Image, Texts and colors Format in HTML & JS

**CHOOSE AN IMAGE FOR YOUR SITE, _A Picture Can Say A Thousand Words_**

In html to be able to add an image you have to use images tags _img_ between <>,
in the tag you need to provide the source using **src** and **alt** if you need a bath, you can control the hirght and the width.

Where an image is placed in the code, for EX:
* before a paragraph.
* inside the start of a paragraph.
* in the middle of a paragraph.
 Also, you can aligned it to the left, right, top, bottom or middle using **Align** also between the tages.

<img align="middle" width="400" height="600" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQG6GtORJo912v8lxkkg5qJ_Xb3KbaH1gboqg&usqp=CAU">

**CHOOSE THE BEST COLOR**

You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:
1. rgb values, these express colors in terms
of how much red, green and blue are used to make it up, for example: rgb(100,100,90)
2. hex codes, these are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green and blue in a color, preceded by a pound or hash # sign, for example: #ee3e80
3. color names, there are 147 predefined color names that are recognized by browsers, for example:
DarkCyan

For the background color, CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears in a box, and the background-color property sets the color of the background for that box. You can specify your choice of background color in the same three ways you can specify foreground colors: RGB values, hex codes, and color names. 

**Now How To make the Texts More lively?**

I believe you already know the answer. Of course it is CSS 

Will CSS as we mintioned, is used to make the degin of the web bage 

CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration. CSS Associates Style rules with HTML elements. For Ex: _p {font-family: Arial;}_

CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two parts: a property and a value, separated by a colon. You can specify several properties in one eclaration, each separated by a semi-colon. CSS Properties Affect How Elements Are Displayed. 
_h1, h2, h3 { font-family: Arial;  color: yellow;}_

you edit the size, color ,type, and everything in about the font:


<img width="500" height="700" src="https://www.onlineprinters.co.uk/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/font-sizes-boundaries.jpeg">


 And to connect between the html and the css you need to provide a link in this formula
 _link href="css/nameOfFile.css" rel="stylesheet"_

**IMAGES IN JAVASCRIPT**

**TL;DR**
Use JPEG format for all images that contain a natural scene or photograph where variation in colour and intensity is smooth. Use PNG format for any image that needs transparency or for images with text & objects with sharp contrast edges like logos. Use GIF format for images that contain animations.
**Compression**
Almost all forms of data that we see on the internet — text, image, video etc. — are compressed to reduce the size of data and ensure faster transmission. Choosing the correct format and compression is a major factor that determines image size.

**Transparency**
In a simple form, transparency indicates something that is completely invisible. Logos and icons often need to be placed on backgrounds with variable colours. Hence it is desirable, that the background of these logos and icons is made transparent so that a single image can be used over multiple background variations.
**Colours**
There is a significant difference in the number of colours that can be supported by these 3 formats.
JPEG images can support around 16 million colours. This is what makes them suitable for storing images of natural scenes.
**Animation**
Animation, in this case, refers to any change or movement in the image. It doesn’t necessarily have to have frame rates like an animated video, but essentially a part or the entire image changes with time.
