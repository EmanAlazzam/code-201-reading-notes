A Study In 2008, by a group of psychologists from Carnegie Mellon, M.I.T. and Union College. Recruited 699 people, divided them into small groups and gave each a series of assignments that required different kinds of cooperation.

What interested the researchers, was that teams that did well on one assignment usually did well on all the others.Conversely, teams that failed at one thing seemed to fail at everything.

A worker today might start the morning by collaborating with a team of engineers, then send emails to colleagues marketing a new brand, then jump on a conference call planning an entirely different product line, while also juggling team meetings with accounting and the party-planning committee.

Sometimes the team’s members got along better as a group than as individual friends.

Yet many of today’s most valuable firms have come to realize that analyzing and improving individual workers ­— a practice known as ‘‘employee performance optimization’’ — isn’t enough.

As commerce becomes increasingly global and complex, the bulk of modern work is more and more team-based.

The time spent by managers and employees in collaborative activities has ballooned by 50 percent or more.

Peoplw working in groups tend to innovate faster, see mistakes more quickly and find better solutions to problems.

Studies also show that people working in teams tend to achieve better results and report higher job satisfaction.

If a company wants to outstrip its competitors, it needs to influence not only how people work but also how they work together.

Google’s People Operations department has scrutinized everything from how frequently particular people eat together (the most productive employees tend to build larger networks by rotating dining companions) to which traits the best managers share (unsurprisingly, good communication and avoiding micromanaging is critical; more shocking, this was news to many Google managers).

In 2012, the company embarked on an initiative — code-named Project Aristotle — to study hundreds of Google’s teams and figure out why some stumbled while others soared. Dubey, a leader of the project, gathered some of the company’s best statisticians, organizational psychologists, sociologists and engineers. He also needed researchers. Rozovsky, by then, had decided that what she wanted to do with her life was study people’s habits and tendencies. After graduating from Yale, she was hired by Google and was soon assigned to Project Aristotle.
