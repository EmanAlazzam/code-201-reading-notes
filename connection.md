# links in HTML file

Links are the defining feature of the web because they allow you to move from one web page to another enabling the very idea of browsing or surfing. Links are created using the _a_ element. Users can click on anything between the opening _a_ tag and the closing _a_ tag. You specify which page you want to link to using the href attribut.

<_a href="URL" >LINK NAME <_/a> using this format you can:
* Linking to Other Sites.
* Linking to Other Pages on the Same Site.
* Email Links.
* Opening Links in a New Window.
* Linking to a Specific Part of the Same Page
* Linking to a Specific Part of Another Page


# layout css
* <_div> elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page.
* Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.
* The float property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi-column layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)
* Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.
* Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide, and indicate what the site is about within the top 600 pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).
* Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
* CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.
* You can include multiple CSS files in one page.

# Functions, Methods, and Objects js

Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements). 
A BASIC FUNCTION example, 


var msg = 'Sign up to receive our newsletter for 10% off!';
function updateMessage() {
var el = document.getElementByld('message'};
el .textContent = msg;
}
updateMessage(};

# Pair Programming

At Code Fellows, pair programing is one way we foster a collaborative environment while developing key industry skills, pair programming is the practice of two developers sharing a single workstation to interactively tackle a coding task together.

## Why pair program?

While learning to code, developers likely study several programming languages. Similar to a foreign language class, there are four fundamental skills that help anyone learn a new language: Listening: hearing and interpreting the vocabulary Speaking: using the correct words to communicate an idea Reading: understanding what written language intends to convey Writing: producing from scratch a meaningful

Pair programming touches on all four skills: developers explain out loud what the code should do, listen to othersâ€™ guidance, read code that others have written, and write code themselves.

During a five-hour paired lab session, Code Fellows students work on all four of these language-specific skills. The abilities they foster will serve them well in completing assignments, in their own communication and learning, in interviews, and in readiness for a job at a company that utilizes this agile practice.
1. Greater efficiency
2. Engaged collaboration
3. Learning from fellow students
4. Social skills
5. Job interview readiness
6. Work environment readiness
