# **Understanding The Problem Domain Is The Hardest Part Of Programming**

What is the hardest thing about writing code?

**A familiar problem**

In a good portion of my Pluralsight courses I show the viewer how to build the “Protein Tracker” application. I am often asked why I keep demonstrating how to build the same simple application over and over again in each of my courses. The answer is “familiarity.”


The idea behind the Protein Tracker application is that it allows a user to set a goal for the amount of protein to consume in a day.  The user can add protein amounts which are added to a total protein count that is tracked for that user.

Very simple functionality, easily explainable, but most importantly, easily understood.

What I found with this simple application was that because it was so easy to understand, the focus was taken off of the problem domain and put instead on the technology.

Not only this, but as I reused this same exact application for teaching a variety of different technologies, it served as a reference problem domain that didn’t have to be re-learned, and provided a way to compare and contrast different technologies—I was getting this teaching mechanism for free if a viewer had already watched one of my other Pluralsight courses.

By creating a familiar problem domain, I found that both the tasks of me teaching a new technology and the viewer learning that technology were much easier, because it is very difficult to learn more than one thing at once.

So what am I trying to say here?

Simply that by taking away the problem domain, or making it so trivial that it is easily understood, I am able to make both teaching and learning easier.

Why problem domains are hard
Have you ever tried to put together a jigsaw puzzle that didn’t have any picture on it?  How about one like this one, that has a very similar pattern repeated on it and is double-sided?
1. Figure out what the major components of the picture are
2. Sort the pieces by color or component
3. Put together all the border pieces
4. Put together each component of the picture from the piles you created
This all breaks down when you don’t have a picture with clear components that you can identify.

The same thing happens when writing code.  Writing code is a lot like putting together a jigsaw puzzle.  We put together code with the purpose of building components that we have taken out of the “bigger picture” of the problem domain.

The big issue is that many problem domains are like a puzzle with a blurry picture or no picture at all.



## WHAT IS AN OBJECT? 

Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of a something you would cognize from the real world. In an object, variables and functions take on new names. 


**DOM**

<img align="right" width="50" height="60" src="https://www.w3schools.com/js/pic_htmltree.gif">

The Document Object Model (DOM) specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how JavaScript can access and update the contents of a web page while it is in the browser window. 
it is an object model to enable the control of the html file for example adding an image, paragaph or eveing a small text.
