#### Practical Information : 

we are going to learn at some practical information that will 
help you launch a successful site.

**The Basics :**

Search engine optimization (or 
SEO) is the practice of trying 
to help your site appear nearer 
the top of search engine results 
when people look for the topics 
that your website covers.

On-Page Techniques: 

On-page techniques are the 
methods you can use on your 
web pages to improve their 
rating in search engines.

Off-Page Techniques :

Getting other sites to link to you 
is just as important as on-page 
techniques. Search engines help 
determine how to rank your 
site by looking at the number of 
other sites that link to yours.



**How To Identify KeyWords And Pharses:**


Determining which keywords to use on your site can be one of the 
hardest tasks when you start to think about SEO. Here are six steps that 
will help you identify the right keywords and phrases for your site.


1- Brainstorm

List down the words that 
someone might type into 
Google to find your site. Be sure 
to include the various topics, 
products or services your site is 
about.


2- Organize

Group the keywords into 
separate lists for the different 
sections or categories of your 
website.

3- Research

There are several tools that let 
you enter your keywords and 
then they will suggest additional 
keywords


4- Compare

It is very unlikely that your 
site will appear at the top of 
the search results for every 
keyword. This is especially true 
for topics where there is a lot 
of competition.


5- Refine

Now you need to pick which 
keywords you will focus on. 
These should always be the ones 
that are most relevant to each 
section of your site.

6- Map

Now that you have a refined list 
of keywords, you know which 
have the most competition, and 
which ones are most relevant, 
it is time to start picking which 
keywords you will use for each 
page.

# Images in Css:
- You can control the size of an image using the width and height properties in CSS.
- use the float property to align images.
- By default, images are inline elements.
- Center an image:
```
img.align-center{
display: block;
margin: 0px auto; or 
taxt-align:center;
}
```
- image Background:
```
selector{
    background-image: url(path);
}
```
- The background property acts like a shorthand for all of the other background properties.
```
body {
background: #ffffff url("images/image.png")
no-repeat top right;
}
```
- rollover: to create a link or button that changes to a second style when a user moves their mouse over it (known as a rollover) and a third style when they click on it.
- Css has the ability to specify a gradient for
the background of a box. The gradient is created using the background-image property
