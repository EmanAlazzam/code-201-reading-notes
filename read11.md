# Images in Css:
- You can control the size of an image using the width and height properties in CSS.
- use the float property to align images.
- By default, images are inline elements.
- Center an image:
```
img.align-center{
display: block;
margin: 0px auto; or 
taxt-align:center;
}
```
- image Background:
```
selector{
    background-image: url(path);
}
```
- The background property acts like a shorthand for all of the other background properties.
```
body {
background: #ffffff url("images/image.png")
no-repeat top right;
}
```
- rollover: to create a link or button that changes to a second style when a user moves their mouse over it (known as a rollover) and a third style when they click on it.
- Css has the ability to specify a gradient for
the background of a box. The gradient is created using the background-image property
