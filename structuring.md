# Structure Of a Wb Page

Today I'm gona take about lists in html, styling boxs in css and some JS codes.

## HTML Lists
There are three types of HTML lists: 
* ordered.
* unordered.
* definition. 

The ordred list can be inserted using _*ol tags*_, Each item in the list is placed between an opening _*li*_ tag and a closing _*/li*_ tag.

The unordred list can be inserted using _*UL*_,  Each item in the list is placed between an opening _*li*_ tag and a closing _*/li*_ tag.

The defenition list is created with the _*dl*_ element and usually consists of a series of terms and their definitions. Inside the _*dl*_ element you will usually see pairs of _*dt*_ and -*dd*_ elements.

## Css Styling of boxs 
You can use CSS to control the dimensions of a box
You can also control the borders, margin and padding for each box with CSS.
It is possible to hide elements using the display and visibility properties.
Border every box has a border (even if it is not visible or is specified to be 0 pixels wide). The border separates the edge of one box from another.
Margin sit outside the edge of the border. You can set the width of a margin to create a gap between the borders of two adjacent boxes
Padding is the space between the border of a box and any content contained within it. Adding padding can increase the readability of its contents.

## JS code

### CREATING AN ARRAY

You create an array and give it a name just like you would any other variable. The values are assigned to the array inside a pair of square brackets, and each value is separated by a comma. The values in the array do not need to be the same data type, so you can store a string, a number and a Boolean all in the same array. This technique for creating an array is known as an array literal. It is usually the preferred method for creating an array.

For EX: colors= ['white',
                 'black',
               'custom'];


### USING IF ... ELSE STATEMENTS 

Here you can see that an if ... e1se statement allows you to provide two sets of code:
1. one set if the condition evaluates to true.
2. another set if the condition is false.

### switch statement
A switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value. Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value.

switch (level) {
case 'One':
title= 'Level1';
break;
case 'Two':
tit 1 e = ' Level 2 ' ;
break;
case ' Three' :
title = 'Level 3' ;
break ;
default :
title= 'Test';
break;

IF ... ELSE
• There is no need to provide an el se
option. (You can just use an if
statement.)
• With a series of if statements, they are
all checked even if a match has been found
(so it performs more slowly than switch).

switch (level) {
case 'One ':
title= 'Level 1 ' ;
break;
case 'Two':
tit 1 e = ' Level 2 ' ;
break;
case ' Three' :
title = 'Level 3' ;
break ;
default :
title= 'Test';
break;}

The difference between If Else Vs Switch
**SWITCH**
* You have a default option that is run if none of the cases match.
* If a match is found, that code is run; then the break statement stops the rest of the switch statement running (providing better performance than multiple if statements).
**IF ... ELSE**
* There is no need to provide an else option. (You can just use an if statement). 
* With a series of if statements, they are all checked even if a match has been found (so it performs more slowly than switch).
